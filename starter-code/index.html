## Steps

The page is split into 4 sections. 

#### Navbar

- The navbar should be `position: fixed`.
- Float the image left, and float a `ul` with the links right.

#### Large image background with text

- Check out [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) on centering things.

#### What's on Spotify section

- It looks like the `div`s take up about a third of the container each. How can you represent this in code?

#### Green Section

- It looks like we have 2 main pieces, a `div` with the text content, and the image of the Spotify player. Position these according to the surrounding green `div`.
- Position the Spotify logo absolutely according to the Green `div`.

### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a css file is created in `main.css` with colors.
